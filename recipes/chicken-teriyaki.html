    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Trust me when I tell you that this teriyaki chicken recipe is the best. Seriously, I love Asian food so much and have tried countless different recipes. This one takes the cake. Plus, it’s simple. Recipes don’t need to be complicated to be delicious! This teriyaki chicken is smothered with the best teriyaki sauce out there, and the chicken soaks it up, making it really flavorful.</p>
    <p>I love chicken teriyaki cooked and eaten with rice and broccoli, but the beauty of this chicken is that you can serve it up with a ton of different sides and it will taste good every time. The flavor combination in the sauce is made with ginger, soy sauce, and garlic, and the aroma in the kitchen makes me so hungry every time. This recipe is simple and easy and tastes like it came straight from a restaurant.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> You can use chicken thighs or breasts for this recipe. Whichever type you prefer will work great.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Pepper:</strong>Use these to your liking to season the chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> You will use the olive oil to cook the chicken in before adding the sauce</li>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce:</strong>I like to use low sodium soy sauce to make this a little bit healthier.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Sugar:</strong>Light or dark brown sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar:</strong>You can use rice vinegar in a pinch!</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic Clove:</strong>If you don’t have a fresh clove of garlic on hand then you can use minced garlic instead. ½ teaspoon equals about 1 clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sesame Oil:</strong>This is essential to usingin a teriyaki sauce!</li>
        <li><strong>Freshly Grated Ginger</strong>Whenever you use fresh ingredients, the flavor is more potent.</li>
        <li><strong>Water and Cornstarch:</strong>This will be used to thicken up the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Sesame Seeds and Green Onions:</strong>These will be used to garnish the top of your chicken!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook Chicken:</strong>Cut the chicken into one inch pieces and salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a wok or skillet over medium high heat and add the chicken. Cook until no longer pink and remove and set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk:</strong>In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, garlic, sesame oil, and ginger. Then, in a separate small bowl whisk the water and cornstarch to make a slurry. Add the cornstarch to the sauce mixture and whisk.</li>
        <li><strong>Thicken Sauce:</strong>Add the sauce to the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and then whisk until it starts to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Toss Chicken with Sauce:</strong>Add the chicken back to the skillet and toss until coated and heated through. Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds. Serve over rice if desired.</li>
    </ol>
