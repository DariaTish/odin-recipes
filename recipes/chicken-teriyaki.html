    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Trust me when I tell you that this teriyaki chicken recipe is the best. Seriously, I love Asian food so much and have tried countless different recipes. This one takes the cake. Plus, it’s simple. Recipes don’t need to be complicated to be delicious! This teriyaki chicken is smothered with the best teriyaki sauce out there, and the chicken soaks it up, making it really flavorful.</p>
    <p>I love chicken teriyaki cooked and eaten with rice and broccoli, but the beauty of this chicken is that you can serve it up with a ton of different sides and it will taste good every time. The flavor combination in the sauce is made with ginger, soy sauce, and garlic, and the aroma in the kitchen makes me so hungry every time. This recipe is simple and easy and tastes like it came straight from a restaurant.</p>
